          Hey Guys! My name is Krishna Addala! I've been working as a Business Intelligence specialist for the past 8+
          years. I've worked at various tech companies and have worked on technologies like SQL, SAP Business Objects,
          Analytics at salesforce and now working with the analytics engineering team at salesforce building UI
          automation and BI related assets.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love playing volleyball over the weekend, and I've just started playing the game from past 2 years and went
          to classes to learn the game and get better at it.
          I'm also a huge fan of anime and cartoons, and big follower of DC, MARVEL content along with Star Wars, Star
          Trek, Lord of the Rings, Interstellar, Dark Knight, and many more.
          Avid video gamer, I started of this journey from when i was kid, all the way from game boy days to ps2, PC
          gaming, and now currently PS4 and awaiting the release of PS5
        </p>
        <p>
          Love watching TV Shows and movies in general. I follow a lot of content on Netflix, Prime and Hulu.
          Coming back to my professional interests, I've been always interested in learning new stuff, and I've
          always challenged myself in which ever job I took to learn those technologies and excel and be successful and
          good at them, and help fellow collagues along the way which will help you learn more as you grow.
          This is the main reason why I've signed up for the course at UC Berkley to step into the shoes of a developer
          and build interactive applications.
